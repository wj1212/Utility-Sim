## Defining the Core Needs

Today's focus is on defining the specific internal drivers for the agents. To ensure the simulation feels grounded in reality, I plan to adopt a needs-based model similar to the one used in The Sims, categorizing drives into Core Needs and Extended Needs. For the Spring semester, my development priority will be strictly on the Core Needs: Hunger and Energy.

Simply put, the agents need to eat and sleep to maintain functionality. For Hunger, I intend to tune the decay and recovery rates so that the agent naturally seeks food approximately three times a day, mimicking a standard human rhythm. Energy is equally critical as it dictates the long-term cycle of the simulation. I plan to configure the sleep mechanics so that an agent requires roughly 6 to 8 hours of rest to fully recover. This duration is important because it will interact directly with the day/night cycle I plan to implement, creating a natural flow to the simulation. While I have identified Extended Needs such as Fun, Social, and Hygiene for future expansion, I will focus on perfecting this survival loop before introducing those quality-of-life layers.

## Establishing Evaluation Metrics

To rigorously compare the Baseline agent against the Utility agent, I have defined three primary quantitative metrics: **Stability, Adaptability, and Memory & Habits**.

The first metric is **Stability**. A frequent issue in basic threshold-based AI is behavioral "jitter," where an agent rapidly switches between conflicting actions without completing them. I plan to measure this by tracking the rate of decision changes per minute. My hypothesis is that the Utility agent, by implementing an inertia factor, will demonstrate significantly smoother and more coherent behavior compared to the Baseline agent, which is likely to oscillate around threshold values.

The second metric is **Adaptability**, which serves as the primary test for emergent behavior. I want to measure how the agent copes when optimal solutions are unavailable. For example, if the Bed object is removed from the environment, a rigid agent might fail completely. However, a Utility agent should theoretically calculate that sleeping on the floor or a sofa, while suboptimal, is better than collapsing. Measuring the time the agent survives without reaching a critical failure state during these resource-scarcity tests will demonstrate the robustness of the architecture.

The third metric focuses on **Memory and Habits**. Rather than implementing a complex database immediately, I plan to simulate habits through "Curve Bias." By adjusting the utility curves, I can create agents that inherently prefer specific interactions, such as watching TV over reading books. I will measure this by analyzing the time budget the agent spends on various activities over a 24-hour cycle. If the data shows consistent behavioral patterns emerging based on these curve configurations, it will validate the system's ability to simulate distinct personalities.
