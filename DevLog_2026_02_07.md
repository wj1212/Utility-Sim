## Planning the Core Loop Implementation
Today marks the beginning of the implementation work for the Simulation Loop. Before opening Unity and writing the scripts, I want to clearly define what needs to be built today, how it will be defined, and why. My goal for this session is to establish the basic Metabolism (Needs) and the Greybox Environment (World).

### 1. Defining the Core Needs
I plan to implement two fundamental needs today: Hunger and Energy. I am choosing these two because they represent conflicting cycles: one is high-frequency (eating), and the other is low-frequency (sleeping).

* Hunger:
    * Definition: Represents the agent's physical fuel.
    * Why: It serves as the primary short-term interrupter. I want the agent to stop what they are doing to eat roughly 3 times a day.
    * Implementation Plan: I will define a NeedType ScriptableObject for Hunger. It will have a faster decay rate (e.g., losing ~15% per hour) to force frequent interactions with the Fridge.
* Energy:
    * Definition: Represents the agent's wakefulness.
    * Why: It drives the long-term Day/Night rhythm.
    * Implementation Plan: I will define a NeedType for Energy with a slow decay rate. The goal is to have the agent stay awake for about 16 game-hours. Unlike Hunger, the recovery process (sleeping) must take a long time to test the agent's ability to "commit" to an action.
* Normalization: All needs will be implemented using a normalized float value from **0.0 (Critical)** to 1.0 **(Satisfied)**. This standardization is essential for the math in my Utility Curves later.

### 2. The Greybox Environment
I don't want to get distracted by art assets right now. I plan to build a "Greybox" (placeholder) environment to test the logic.

* The Room: I will construct a small, enclosed room (approx. 10x10 units).
* The Furniture:
    * One Fridge: A simple green block. It will be configured with a SmartObjectData profile that restores Hunger.
    * One Bed: A simple blue block. It will be configured to restore Energy over a longer duration.

### 3. Lighting and Time
To visually verify that Energy is decaying correctly relative to time, I plan to implement a basic 24-hour Day/Night Cycle.

* How: I will use a global 2D Light.
* Logic: A script will modulate the light color from White (Day) to Dark Blue (Night) based on a timer. This visual feedback is crucial for debugging the agent's sleep schedule.

## Future Outlook
While today's focus is on this "Survival MVP," I am laying the groundwork for future expansions.
* Economy & Variety: Later, I can expand the Fridge to offer different food items with prices, adding an economic constraint curve.
* Mood: I can introduce a "Comfort" need, where better beds restore Energy faster or boost a Mood stat.
* Social: Once this solo loop works, adding a second agent will allow testing of social friction (e.g., blocking the bathroom).

But for today, the priority is simply getting one agent, one room, and two needs functioning correctly in the data layer.
