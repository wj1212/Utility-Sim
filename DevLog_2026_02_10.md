### Core Implementation: Metabolism and Movement

* Metabolism System: Implemented AgentMetabolism for real-time decay of Hunger and Energy (normalized 0.0 - 1.0).
* Navigation: Abandoned NavMesh and A* Pathfinding Project due to Unity 6 compatibility and security (HTTP) errors. Implemented a custom Physics-based movement system using Rigidbody2D and CircleCollider2D.
* Object Perception: Agents now actively scan the environment for SmartObject components to retrieve interaction data (SmartObjectData).

### Interaction Refinement

* Restoration Logic: Refactored the interaction system from instant refill to incremental restoration (tick-based). Needs now increase gradually over the duration of the action.
* Threshold Triggers: Established baseline decision logic using hard thresholds (e.g., Hunger < 0.3).
* Parameter Tuning: Adjusted BaseDecayRate, StopDistance, and IsTrigger settings to ensure reliable loop execution.

### Current Status

* Baseline Agent: Functional. The agent can autonomously cycle between eating (Fridge) and sleeping (Bed) based on survival priorities.
* Greybox Environment: Basic 10x10 room with functional furniture placeholders verified.
* Progress: Timeline for Baseline Agent implementation (originally scheduled for March) is ahead of schedule.
